Libraries-> ReactJs, AngularJS, VueJS etc...

1. ReactJs uses Virtual DOM inorder when changes in the elements happen. Virtual DOM is way faster than Real DOM
2. Advantages with React is also when a certain part of an HTML page occur if we dont use React library it reloads whole HTML page but where as React it makes use of Components so
   they just change the component.
3. React is a component based Front end Library.
4. These Components are independent and reusable.

Two type of components
1. Functional 
2. Class-based

Class-Based Components

In this firstly we import react and a structure component

Code:
  import React, {Component} from 'react'

Now 2 questions may arise they are from where are we importing this, and why are we importing

Answer for that question is:

1. We need to import this to use the entiretiy of this react library.
2. Regular js class extends react component

Code:

      class Example extends Component{
         render(){
            return <div> Hello </div>
         }
      }

the render method describes how should the UI look like.

Functional Components

import React from 'react'  --> Now a days in newer version this line is also not needed.
// write a function

const Example = () =>{
   return <div> Hi </div>
}

this return line is not a string nor HTML it is an JSX

JSX-> used in React to describe what an user interface should look like.

Install Node, React, Vite Vscode before starting working on projects....

What is create-react-app?

Start building single or multipage website. Simple tool or commad that generates the required files and folders to start the react app and run it in the browser.

To run this commad we need node js installed in the computer (npx create-react-app my-app).
while doing this if it shows behind the release error the
use this command npx create-react-app@latest app-name.



Start doing this on your Vs code.

Folder Structure

node_modules Contains all dependencies required by the app. Main dependencies also listed in package.json

public Contains static assets including index.html (page template)

index.html
title
fonts
css
favicon
id="root" - our entire app

src In simplest form it's the brain of our app. This is where we will do all of our work. src/index.js is the JavaScript entry point.

.gitignore Specifies which files source control (Git) should ignore

package.json Every Node.js project has a package.json and it contains info about our project, for example list of dependencies and scripts

package-lock.json A snapshot of the entire dependency tree

README The file where you can share more info about the project for example build instructions and summary.
